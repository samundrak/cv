Currently i am student of an IT college. I always want to be part of good company where I can sharp my skill and want to gain more knowledge from seniors and experience people. I always want to be in environment of skilled and talented person who can share there power with me.

I take programming as passion , interest, love , life and some time just to  pass my time.I don&#39;t like to be language specific i just want to learn it what takes my attention or what is in need.   Being comfortable in selected language is important and i do that but also having knowledge of others will help me to understand the system more which current language may lack.

I believe in self study almost every thing i know is studied myself which most programmer do  but i always take others view and suggestion to check whether i missed out something.I take hackathon as entertainment and almost every weekend i do it with myself and later on completion or not i push it to my repo on git.
